# Forgotten Apes

How many Bored Apes are lost forever? This was the initial question that I sought to answer while building this project.

## Lost Apes

I decided to use 3 criteria to determine if an ape is lost:

- Ape did not claim $APE coin
- Ape did not claim Otherside land
- Ethereum Address containing the Ape has had no activity since the Otherside mint

Based on this criteria, 68 apes are lost forever. You can view all of them here: https://www.forgottenapes.xyz/lost-apes
