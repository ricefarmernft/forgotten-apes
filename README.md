# Forgotten Apes

How many Bored Apes are lost forever? This was the initial question that I sought to answer while building this project.

## Vision

My vision for this project was to showcase all of the apes that are considered “lost” according to certain criteria. This made me think about certain data points I could use to narrow down this amount.

I decided to find 5 different data points that would help me determine if an ape was lost:

1. Unclaimed $Ape
2. Unclaimed Dog
3. Unclaimed Otherside
4. Burned Apes
5. No Transfers

## Features

- Homepage
- Lost Apes
- Unclaimed $APE coin
- Unclaimed Dog
- Unclaimed Otherside Land
- Burned Apes
- No Transfers
- Ape Details

## Lost Apes

I decided to use 3 criteria to determine if an ape is lost:

- Ape did not claim $APE coin
- Ape did not claim Otherside land
- Ethereum Address containing the Ape has had no activity since the Otherside mint

Based on this criteria, 68 apes are lost forever. You can view all of them [here](https://www.forgottenapes.xyz/lost-apes)
